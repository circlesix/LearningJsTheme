# Learning Javascript in Magento 2

This is an example theme to follow along with my tutorial series covering the use of Javascript in Magento 2 

## Getting Started

Clone this repo into your Magento install at `{magento_root}/app/design/frontend`
with `git clone https://github.com/circlesix/LearnJs.git` from the command line. 

Once the code is there, you can set the theme in the admin at `Content -> Configuration` and set the theme there. After that, you can checkout to the respective branch that has the content you are working on for that blog post. 

### Prerequisites

You will need to have a working development install of [Magento 2](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/install-gde/bk-install-guide.html) with [sample data](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/install/sample-data-after-magento.html) installed.
