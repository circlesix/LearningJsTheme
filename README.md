# Learning Javascript in Magento 2

This is an example theme to follow along with my tutorial series covering the use of Javascript in Magento 2. The `master` branch has the minimun required files to register your theme. Each branch will match the blog post with the final code of the tutorial. There is no need to copy this repo to follow along, each post will cover all the needed code. This repo exists as a reference for the work we are doing along the way. 

The blog series began [with this post about Magento 2 and Require JS](http://circlesixdigital.com/introduction-to-javascript-in-magento-2/). There is no code associated with that post. 

## Getting Started

Clone this repo into your Magento install at `{magento_root}/app/design/frontend`
with `git clone https://github.com/circlesix/LearningJsTheme.git` from the command line. 

Once the code is there, you can set the theme in the admin at `Content -> Configuration` and set the theme there. After that, you can checkout to the respective branch that has the content you are working on for that blog post. 

### Prerequisites

You will need to have a working development install of [Magento 2](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/install-gde/bk-install-guide.html) with [sample data](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/install/sample-data-after-magento.html) installed.

I really like [Mark Shust's Docker Magento 2 project](https://github.com/markoshust/docker-magento). In the blog posts, this is what I will be using. Of course there is no requirement to use this, please use whatever development platform you like.
